#KNOWN ISSUES:

#events are not following any rules besides acts.
#no tutorial
#no proper error logging yet.
#Skipping Black Star second artifact makes it inaccessible.
#you can also skip green key forever I think 
#just saw 4 shops in a row.
# Need to improve visuals of watch discard and watch exhaust pile
#probably the shopitems that are replenished by courier need to be upgraded based on the act and affected by the eggs too.
#fixed some stuff with eventshops not properly being handled as shops in some regards.
