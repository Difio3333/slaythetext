# Update Januar 16th 2024

Hey everyone. I've noticed that this repository is consistently collecting stars and downloads so I thought I'd continue working on this a little bit more.
This I've implemented Defect now as the third char. Might still be buggy but most of the cards should work.

# General Info

The game is still in Alpha so there a lot of bugs and weird messages in the game but you can now play as Ironclad, Silent and Defect.

# Download:

## Windows:
https://github.com/Difio3333/slaythetext/releases/download/v0.7/slaythetext.exe
(no Defect in here, clone the repo in order to get them)
## Mac:
https://github.com/Difio3333/slaythetext/releases/download/v0.7/slaythetext
(no Defect in here, clone the repo in order to get them)
## Linux:
I currently don't have an executable but you can just clone the repo and install the dependency "ansimarkup" via 'pip install ansimarkup' and then just run main.py.
