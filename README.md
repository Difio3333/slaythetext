# Update Januar 16th 2024

Hey everyone. I've notied that this repository is consistently collecting stars and downloads so I thought I'd continue working on this a little bit more.
This I've implemented Defect now as the third char. Might still be buggy but most of the cards should work.

# General Info

The game is still in Alpha so there a lot of bugs and weird messages in the game but you can now play as Ironclad, Silent and Defect.

Download (no Defect in these builds):

Windows:
https://github.com/Difio3333/slaythetext/releases/download/v0.7/slaythetext.exe

Mac:
https://github.com/Difio3333/slaythetext/releases/download/v0.7/slaythetext

Linux:
I currently don't have an executable but you can just clone the repo and install the dependency "ansimarkup" via 'pip install ansimarkup' and then just run main.py.

You can check out 20 minutes of me talking and playing over the game here (shows an older Version, new Video will come soon):
